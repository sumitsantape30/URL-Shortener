# URL-Shortner
A GUI based URL Shortner

A URL shortener is a simple tool that takes a long URL and turns it into whatever URL you would like it to be.
It's much simpler to share a short and memorable URL than a lengthy one, especially when those lengthy URLs
contain random numbers in them. ... Whenever you are sharing a link in a public setting, you should be using
a link shortening tool to help pretty up the link and track the number of click-throughs.
